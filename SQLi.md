SQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. This can allow an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data that belongs to other users, or any other data that the application can access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior.

You can detect SQL injection manually using a systematic set of tests against every entry point in the application. To do this, you would typically submit:

- The single quote character `'` and look for errors or other anomalies.
- Some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value, and look for systematic differences in the application responses.
- Boolean conditions such as `OR 1=1` and `OR 1=2`, and look for differences in the application's responses.
- Payloads designed to trigger time delays when executed within a SQL query, and look for differences in the time taken to respond.
- OAST payloads designed to trigger an out-of-band network interaction when executed within a SQL query, and monitor any resulting interactions.

Most SQL injection vulnerabilities occur within the `WHERE` clause of a `SELECT` query. Most experienced testers are familiar with this type of SQL injection.

However, SQL injection vulnerabilities can occur at any location within the query, and within different query types. Some other common locations where SQL injection arises are:

- In `UPDATE` statements, within the updated values or the `WHERE` clause.
- In `INSERT` statements, within the inserted values.
- In `SELECT` statements, within the table or column name.
- In `SELECT` statements, within the `ORDER BY` clause.

Misconfiguration of the database sometimes results in verbose error messages. These can provide information that may be useful to an attacker. For example, consider the following error message, which occurs after injecting a single quote into an `id` parameter:

`Unterminated string literal started at position 52 in SQL SELECT * FROM tracking WHERE id = '''. Expected char`

This shows the full query that the application constructed using our input. We can see that in this case, we're injecting into a single-quoted string inside a `WHERE` statement. This makes it easier to construct a valid query containing a malicious payload. Commenting out the rest of the query would prevent the superfluous single-quote from breaking the syntax.

---
You can use the `CAST()` function to achieve this. It enables you to convert one data type to another. For example, imagine a query containing the following statement:

`CAST((SELECT example_column FROM example_table) AS int)`

Often, the data that you're trying to read is a string. Attempting to convert this to an incompatible data type, such as an `int`, may cause an error similar to the following:

`ERROR: invalid input syntax for type integer: "Example data"`

This type of query may also be useful if a character limit prevents you from triggering conditional responses.
